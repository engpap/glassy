# Glassy

## Project specification
Botanical gardens and open-air museums often experience a lack of interest. 
Despite the growing enviornment concerns, the majority of people are less attraced by these spaces compared to history and science musuems. 
We aim to tackle this issue by creating Glassy, an augmented reality software for enhancing digital-and-physical experience in botanical gardens through the use of nReal glasses. 
The application allows users to move in an augmented reality space simply by walking around the museum and by using hand gestures to get relavant information about plants, flowers and trees. 
Virtual and interactale objects are displayed next to plants providing general details, over-time evolution and usages in medicine.  
Eventually, the visiting experience is improved.
